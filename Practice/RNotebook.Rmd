# I've already included 5 in-line codes. I am trying to due with the tests' results, and I originally I want to includes them as assignment 17. But I changed my mind that I will go to OH on Tuesday to check if the ones I am palnning to run are the best way to do so. Thank you~

# Assignment 15: data analysis plans
I wanted to compare the differences in general SDS depression scores, the differences in Somatic scores, the differences in Cognitive Impairment scores, and the differences in Feelings of Despair scores between Chinese adolescent males and females. Meanwhile, I plan to examine if there are any kinds of gender differences in depressed adolescences for the levels of depression, including mild, moderate, and severe (this is a categorical variable). 
Descriptive Analysis: Mean and Standard deviation + Frequency analysis(the categorical variable of depression level).
Data Analysis: 
Chi-square tests to assess whether the distribution of depression levels differs between males and females.
Linear regression will be apply to test gender difference between different score types(including self-reported depression scores, somatic scores, cognitive impairment scores, and feelings of despair scores). Then an ANOVA test will be used to check

#Assignment 14: kable + reference 
As seen in Table \\@ref(tab:gender-depression), the data shows the average SDS Depression Score (Mean) for females is higher. Meanwhile, the standard deviation (SD) of the Depression Scores for males is higher, indicating greater variability or dispersion in the scores among males.

#Male Depression Score: Mean = 71.84298 , SD = 9.518432

depression_scores <- data.frame(
  Gender = c("Male", "Female"),
  Mean = c(71.84, 75.39),
  SD = c(9.52, 9.01)

```
Based on this preliminary distribution, it might be suggested that adolescent females experience more severe levels of depression, as indicated by the higher average SDS Depression Score. 

As seen in Figure 1\\@ref(fig:gender-somatic), female (pink) had a higher somatic score than male (blue).
