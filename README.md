# Exploring the Gender Difference in Depression Severity and Depressive Symptoms in Chinese Adolescents
-----------------------------

## Destription
Chinese adolescents' mental health has received attention from scholars in recent years. This study encompasses an analysis of 577 eligible Chinese depression adolescents aged 10 to 19 years, examining gender differences in depression severity and in three depressive symptom factors: somatization/anxiety, cognitive impairment, and hopelessness. The Chinese version of HAMD-24 is used. A linear regression analysis is performed to show the general picture and explore gender differences in overall depression scores. Furthermore, four t-tests were employed to identify gender differences in the total depression score, as well as examine the gender role in each of the three symptom factors. The results indicate that among Chinese adolescents with depression, females exhibit greater depression severity and more intense symptoms of cognitive impairment and hopelessness than their male counterparts. The objective of this report is to make a substantial contribution to our broader ongoing research on adolescent depression in China while deepening insights into the gender-based variations in these conditions and informing clinical approaches.
