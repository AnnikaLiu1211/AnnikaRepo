## Description
This extensive dataset comprises information from 557 Chinese adolescent subjects, encompassing essential demographic details such as biological sex and age (ranging from 10 to 19 years). Additionally, the dataset encompasses outcomes derived from three clinical psychology assessments, namely the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD).
** The Self-Rating Depression Scale is the most important measure in this study
* Adolescents: aged 10 to 19 years (WHO standards), male or female

## Overall plan
The title of the research would be: Exploring Comorbid Symptoms Manifestation in Chinese Adolescents with Depression. Two major expections of the study are: 
          (a) Identify and categorize comorbid symptoms commonly associated with adolescent depression
          (b) Explore potential correlations between specific comorbid symptoms and the severity of depression, as well as the correlation between different symptoms.
