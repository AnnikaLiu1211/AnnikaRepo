# Depression in Chinese Adolescents
-----------------------------

## Destription/Abstract
This report will be part of a study on depression among Chinese adolescents. 577 eligible adolescents(age from 10 to 19, HAM-D score equal or greater than 8) have been included. As part of a long-term project, this report will only focus on analyzing gender differences in the severity of depression and on three symptoms, including anxiety/somatization, cognitive impairment, and a sense of despair. A multiple linear regression analysis will probe the influence and interaction of symptom scores and gender on depression scores. Four t-tests will be used to detect gender differences in the total depression score in the HAM-D 24 Chinese version, and the three symptom factors. This report aims to make a substantive contribution to the large study of depression among Chinese adolescents while seeking to cultivate a deeper understanding of the gender disparities in adolescent depression and contributing to the clinical implementation.
