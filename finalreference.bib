Social cognitive processes involved in navigating increasingly complex and intimate relationships continue to develop throughout adolescence. Here, we describe the functional and structural changes occurring in the brain during this period of life and how they relate to navigating the social environment. Areas of the social brain undergo both structural changes and functional reorganization during the second decade of life, possibly reﬂecting a sensitive period for adapting to one’s social environment. The changes in social environment that occur during adolescence might interact with increasing executive functions and heightened social sensitivity to inﬂuence a number of adolescent behaviors. We discuss the importance of considering the social environment and social rewards in research on adolescent cognition and behavior. Finally, we speculate about the potential implications of this research for society.},

	abstract = {Objective
Experiencing depression in adolescence can disrupt important developmental processes, which can have longstanding effects on socioeconomic status and relationships. The objective of this article was to systematically review the evidence examining associations between adolescent depression and adult psychosocial outcomes.
Method
Five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ERIC) were searched for articles published from 1980 through March 2017. Eligible articles were peer reviewed, published in English, had prospective cohort study designs, and contrasted adult psychosocial outcomes in those with versus without adolescent depression. Outcomes with sufficient data were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses, with summary measures reported as odds ratios (ORs). A protocol for this review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017059662).
Results
Of the 4,988 references screened for inclusion, 31 articles comprising 136 analyses were included for review. Twenty-four cohorts were represented. Seventy-seven analyses across 10 outcomes were meta-analyzed, with remaining analyses summarized narratively. Meta-analyses suggested that adolescent depression was associated with outcomes including, but not limited to, failure to complete secondary school (OR 1.76, 95\% CI 1.29–2.39), unemployment (OR 1.66, 95\% CI 1.29–2.14), and pregnancy/parenthood (OR 1.38, 95\% CI 1.06–1.81).
Conclusion
This review demonstrates that adolescent depression is associated with a myriad of adult psychosocial outcomes. Many are linked and can lead to the propagation of difficulties across the lifespan. These findings can have important implications for encouraging the provision of targeted mental health care early in development to improve life chances.},

School-related problems were the predominant sources of worry. One third reported a history of depression, 16\% had at times felt life was not worth living, and 9\% reported that they had attempted suicide. Girls were more likely to report symptoms of depression. Patterns of help-seeking showed reliance on friends and parents; only 1\% had sought professional help.

	abstract = {Due to traditional cultural values and a rapidly expanding economy, Mainland Chinese adolescents commonly experience high levels of pressure from their parents to perform well in school, which may have negative effects on adolescents’ psychological functioning. Data from 997 students in four Beijing high schools were used to examine relationships of Chinese parents’ warmth and parental pressure regarding students’ academic work with the adolescents’ levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. The study also tested whether a parent’s level of warmth can moderate negative effects on adolescent symptoms of the parent’s own academic pressure on the adolescent, as well as negative effects of the other parent’s pressure. Gender differences in associations between parenting behavior and adolescent functioning were explored. Both female and male adolescents rated mothers as displaying higher warmth and pressure than their fathers, but although both parents’ behaviors were associated with children’s mental health, overall fathers’ parenting (especially academic pressure) had stronger associations than mothers’ parenting with adolescents’ depression and anxiety. Greater parental warmth generally reduced the association between that parent’s academic pressure and adolescents’ psychopathology symptoms, but one parent’s warmth had mixed impacts on effects of the other’s pressure. Implications of the findings for fostering adolescent mental health in the context of the Chinese concept of “training” children to be academically successful are discussed.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The association of suicide with the use of oral contraceptives (OC) is unknown in the Asian population. We aimed to evaluate the association of OC use and suicidal behavior in a nationally representative population of Korean women.
Method
Of the 44,501 women who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) (2007–2016), 27,067 women aged 20 years or older who had completed information on OC use and suicidal behavior were included. Women with a history of cancer were excluded. Compared to non-users of OC, odds ratios (ORs) for suicide attempt/ideation were calculated using a multivariable logistic regression among OC users, with testing of the interaction term of OC use and history of depression. We also conducted a stratified analysis by history of depression.
Results
A total of 4,067 women (14.0\%) reported they had suicide ideations or had attempted suicide, respectively. OC use was associated with an increased prevalence of suicidality (OR = 1.13, 95\% CI 1.00–1.24) after adjustments for age, demographic factors, age of menarche, and lifestyle behaviors. When stratified by history of depression diagnosis, ORs linearly increased as the total duration of OC use lengthened among women with a history of depression; however, women without a history of depression showed peaked OR at 4- to 12-month use.
Conclusion
There is an increased association between OC use and suicidality and the pattern of the relationship differs depending on whether there is a history of depression.},

	abstract = {BackgroundAdolescent depression has become a leading problem around the world, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic has remained prevalent and heavily influenced people’s mental health. While gender difference has always been a topic in the field of psychiatry, there are cultural differences across the world that must be taken into account. The current study is examining gender differences in symptoms of Chinese adolescents with depression.MethodsThe sample was obtained from a total of 574 adolescent patients (172 males and 402 females) diagnosed with depression following the DSM-IV/ICD-10 diagnostic criteria; patients who also had other severe mental or physical illnesses were excluded. The ages of participants ranged from 10 to 19 years. Additionally, independent t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to examine differences in symptoms between different gender and age groups. The LPA was used to examine whether females and males were having different patterns of symptoms.ResultsOur analysis showed that compared to males, females exhibited higher rates of depression and more severe depressive symptoms across age groups. Likewise, the analysis also revealed an earlier onset of depression among Chinese adolescents compared to that in Western countries in previous studies. Finally, the LPA showed that mild to moderate depression was predominant in male patients, while severe depression was predominant in female patients.ConclusionThis study highlights the gender differences in the prevalence and severity of depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents. The current study highlighted the importance of gender equality and developing gender-friendly interventions in maintaining the overall mental health of adolescents in China.},

Participants were 10–14 year olds who participated in a large Australian population study (n = 6,552). Depressive symptoms and pubertal development were assessed using the self‐report Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and the Pubertal Development Scale. Three indicators of stress exposure were examined—low emotional closeness to parents, residential and school transitions, and family conflict. The effect of gender, stress exposure and the interaction of gender and stress exposure on depressive symptoms was tested using multivariate logistic regression. High family conflict, residential instability and low emotional closeness with parents were independently associated with adolescent depressive symptoms. There was a significant gender by emotional closeness interaction; females reporting low emotional closeness to their parents were 2.3 times more likely to report high depressive symptoms than females reporting high emotional connections with parents. Female adolescents may be more susceptible to particular types of stresses and particularly the quality of the parent‐child relationship.},
